Julia set = points in the complex plane for which the iteration z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c does not tend to infinity

c = complex constant

z0 = initial value of iteration (coordinates on screen)

algorithm:

	- iterate over pixels in the image pane. 
	- set pixel to z0 and start iterating the function
	- if the iteration diverges, paint the pixel white		=> decision procedure for divergence and convergence is required
	- if the iteration converges, paint the pixel black
